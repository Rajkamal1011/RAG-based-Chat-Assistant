The students enrolled in this programme are expected to complete the course work and research work and submit their M.

In principle, all the students are provided with the scholarship as per the norms of the Institution.  2.1M.

Tech (Res)  IISc offers a post-graduate research programme i.e., M. Tech (Research). The students enrolled in this programme are expected to complete the course work and research work and submit their M.

In principle, all the students are provided with the scholarship as per the norms of the Institution.  2.1M.

Tech (Res)  IISc offers a post-graduate research programme i.e., M. Tech (Research). The students enrolled in this programme are expected to complete the course work and research work and submit their M. Tech (Research) thesis by the end of their registration period as per the norms of the Institution. In principle, all the students are provided with the scholarship as per the norms of the Institution.  2.1M. Tech (Research) 2 1 2½ 2.1.1  The minimum and maximum periods mentioned above are counted from the term in the academic year when the students are admitted for the programme (i.e., August Term or January Term,  accordingly).  Students  are  provided  with  hostel  rooms  (if  available)  only  for  the  above durations of the residence requirements. Once the maximum period is completed, the studentship is  terminated,  and  the  students  cannot  stay  in  the  hostel  rooms  beyond  the  maximum  periods mentioned.
